  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roslint" with any
  of the following names:

    roslintConfig.cmake
    roslint-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "roslint" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "roslint_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "roslint" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
